# Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account 
The first two things you'll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account.

Follow the instructions here (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install git. Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command. A note: 95% of other online git resources and discussions will also be for the command-line interface. 

Installing Git on Linux
In Debian-based linux systems, open a terminal window. Copy & paste the following into the terminal window and hit Return. You may be prompted to enter your password.

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git

Once you've done that, create a GitHub account here (https://github.com/).

Git and GitHub
A quick aside: git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and "host-your-own" solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred to in git-speak as "remotes", and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.

# Step 1: Create a local git repository 
When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository (or often, 'repo', for short). 

To use git we'll be using the terminal. If you don't have much experience with the terminal and basic commands, check out this tutorial (If you don’t want/ need a short history lesson, skip to step three.)

To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the cd (change directory) command. For example, if you have a 'projects' folder on your desktop, you'd do something like:

cd ~/Desktop
mkdir myproject
cd myproject/
git init

# Step 2: Add a new file to the repo
Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. 

touch test.txt

Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that  the file exists inside the repo. But, git won't track the file unless you explicitly tell it to. Git only saves/manages changes to files that it tracks, so we’ll need to send a command to confirm that yes, we want git to track our new file.

After creating the new file, you can use the git status command to see which files git knows exist.

git status

What this basically says is, "Hey, we noticed you created a new file called test.txt, but unless you use the 'git add' command we aren't going to do anything with it."

An interlude: The staging environment, the commit, and you
One of the most confusing parts when you're first learning git is the concept of the staging environment and how it relates to a commit. A commit is a record of what changes you have made since the last time you made a commit. Essentially, you make changes to your repo (for example, adding a file or modifying one) and then tell git to put those changes into a commit. Commits make up the essence of your project and allow you to jump to the state of a project at any other commit.

So, how do you tell git which files to put into a commit? This is where the staging environment or index come in. As seen in Step 2, when you make changes to your repo, git notices that a file has changed but won't do anything with it (like adding it in a commit). To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the git add <filename> command (see Step 3 below). Once you've used the git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell git to package them into a commit using the git commit command. 

Note: The staging environment, also called 'staging', is the new preferred term for this, but you can also see it referred to as the 'index'.

# Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment
Add a file to the staging environment using the git add command. 

git add .

If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the "Changes to be committed" line). 

git status

To reiterate, the file has not yet been added to a commit, but it's about to be.

# Step 4: Create a commit
It's time to create your first commit!

Run the command:

git commit -m "new file"

The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it's a new feature, maybe it's a bug fix, maybe it's just fixing a typo. Don't put a message like "asdfadsf" or "foobar". That makes the other people who see your commit sad. Very, very, sad. Commits live forever in a repository (technically you can delete them if you really, really need to but it’s messy), so if you leave a clear explanation of your changes it can be extremely helpful for future programmers (perhaps future you!) who are trying to figure out why some change was made years later.

# Step 5: Create a new branch
Now that you've made a new commit, let's try something a little more advanced. Say you want to make a new feature but are worried about making changes to the main project while developing the feature. This is where git branches come in. 

Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. Official git docs describe branches this way: 'A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.' For instance, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part of the project. Once you're done with the page, you can merge your changes from your branch into the primary branch. When you create a new branch, Git keeps track of which commit your branch 'branched' off of, so it knows the history behind all the files. 

Let's say you are on the primary branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do:

git checkout -b first_branch

This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the primary branch.

After running the above command, you can use the git branch command to confirm that your branch was created:

git branch

The branch name with the asterisk next to it indicates which branch you're on at that given time. 

A note on branch names
By default, every git repository’s first branch is named 'master' (and is typically used as the primary branch in the project). As part of the tech industry's general anti-racism work, some groups have begun to use alternate names for the default branch (we are using "primary" in this tutorial, for example). In other documentation and discussions, you may see "master", or other terms, used to refer to the primary branch. Regardless of the name, just keep in mind that nearly every repository has a primary branch that can be thought of as the official version of the repository. If it's a website, then the primary branch is the version that users see. If it's an application, then the primary branch is the version that users download. This isn't technically necessary (git doesn't treat any branches differently from other branches), but it's how git is traditionally used in a project.

If you are curious about the decision to use different default branch names, GitHub has an explanation of their change here: https://github.com/github/renaming

Make some changes to test.txt
gedit test.txt

Don't forget to stage the changes and commit them:
git add .
git status
git commit -m "some changes"

# Step 6: Create a new repository on GitHub
If you only want to keep track of your code locally, you don't need to use GitHub. But if you want to work with a team, you can use GitHub to collaboratively modify the project's code.

To create a new repo on GitHub, log in and go to the GitHub home page. You can find the "New repository" option under the "+" sign next to your profile picture, in the top right corner of the navbar. After clicking the button, GitHub will ask you to name your repo and provide a brief description. When you're done filling out the information, press the 'Create repository' button to make your new repo.

GitHub will ask if you want to create a new repo from scratch or if you want to add a repo you have created locally. In this case, since we've already created a new repo locally, we want to push that onto GitHub so follow the '....or push an existing repository from the command line' section: 

git remote add origin https://github.com/JohnnyRyan1/River_Discharge.git
git push -u origin master

(You'll want to change the URL in the first command line to what GitHub lists in this section since your GitHub username and repo name are different.)
Note that I had to generate a personal access token in Settings --> Developer Settings and enter it as a password.

You'll see that the changes you made to test.txt in the new branch were not pushed to repository because we only pushed the "master" branch.

# Step 7: Push a branch to GitHub
Now we'll push the changes we made in test.txt in the new branch to the new GitHub repo. This allows other people to see the changes you've made. If they're approved by the repository's owner, the changes can then be merged into the primary branch. First make sure you are checked out into the new branch:

git checkout first_branch
git branch

To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, you'll want to run git push origin yourbranchname. GitHub will automatically create the branch for you on the remote repository:

git push origin first_branch

You might be wondering what that "origin" word means in the command above. What happens is that when you clone a remote repository to your local machine, git creates an alias for you. In nearly all cases this alias is called "origin." It's essentially shorthand for the remote repository's URL. So, to push your changes to the remote repository, you could've used either the command: git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname or git push origin yourbranchname

(If this is your first time using GitHub locally, it might prompt you to log in with your GitHub username and password.)

If you refresh the GitHub page, you'll see note saying a branch with your name has just been pushed into the repository. You can also click the 'branches' link to see your branch listed there.

Now click the green button in the screenshot above. We're going to make a pull request!

# Step 8: Create a pull request (PR)
A pull request (or PR) is a way to alert a repo's owners that you want to make some changes to their code. It allows them to review the code and make sure it looks good before putting your changes on the primary branch.

You might see a big green button at the bottom that says 'Merge pull request'. Clicking this means you'll merge your changes into the primary branch..

Sometimes you'll be a co-owner or the sole owner of a repo, in which case you may not need to create a PR to merge your changes. However, it's still a good idea to make one so you can keep a more complete history of your updates and to make sure you always create a new branch when making changes.

# Step 9: Merge a PR
Go ahead and click the green 'Merge pull request' button. This will merge your changes into the primary branch.

When you're done, I recommend deleting your branch (too many branches can become messy), so hit that grey 'Delete branch' button as well.

You can double check that your commits were merged by clicking on the 'Commits' link on the first page of your new repo.

This will show you a list of all the commits in that branch. You can see the one I just merged right up top (Merge pull request #1).

You can also see the hash code of the commit on the right hand side. A hash code is a unique identifier for that specific commit. It's useful for referring to specific commits and when undoing changes (use the git revert <hash code number> command to backtrack).

# Step 10: Get changes on GitHub back to your computer
Right now, the repo on GitHub looks a little different than what you have on your local machine. For example, the commit you made in your branch and merged into the primary branch doesn't exist in the primary branch on your local machine.

In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the git pull origin master command (when working on the primary branch). In most cases, this can be shortened to "git pull". You'll first need to switch back to master:

git checkout master
git pull origin master

This shows you all the files that have changed and how they've changed.

Now we can use the git log command again to see all new commits.

git log

# Step 11: Bask in your git glory
You've successfully made a PR and merged your code to the primary branch. Congratulations!

# Step 12: Task 

Ask students do a pull request and commit on each others code
