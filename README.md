# Introduction to Remote Sensing 

Course materials for Remote Sensing 1 (GEOG 4/585) taught at the Department of Geography, University of Oregon. This course provides an introduction to remote sensing - the acquisition of data about the world from afar. Often this is in the form of digital imagery acquired by aircraft or satellites, but a variety of other types of remote sensing exist and are discussed in the class. 

We will cover the physical science principles involved in remote sensing, the instruments and platforms used to collect data, and the analysis/visualization of the acquired information. Topics include data acquisition and pre-processing, image enhancement,  data classification and visualization. The emphasis of the class is on pixel-based raster spectral data (such as satellite or drone imagery), and other types of remote sensing information - such as lidar, radar, and structure-from-motion (SfM) are also addressed in lectures and lab exercises.
